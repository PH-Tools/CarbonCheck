Comparing the performance of your proposed building design to a standard 'baseline' is a common practice among many energy-modeling workflows. This is especially true for any project seeking public funding to offset the costs of high-performance building components. However, constructing this 'baseline' model can be a time-consuming and error-prone task for modeling teams. This is where CarbonCheck comes in: a new tool specifically designed for New York State Passive House projects, designed to streamline the process of creating baseline models. CarbonCheck seamlessly integrates with both PHPP and WUFI-Passive software, ensuring compatibility and ease of use for any Passive House team.

</br>CarbonCheck is an open-source tool, provided free of charge, created to support the Passive House Community in New York State. We encourage you to download and try it out for yourself.

## Install Trouble?
If you run into any errors or trouble during install.
- Make sure you are using the most up-to-date CarbonCheck installer version.
- On Windows, be sure that you are installing the application to a folder that you have permission to add to. If you are having trouble installing to your "C:\ProgramFiles" directory, try installing to your root "C:\" directory instead.
